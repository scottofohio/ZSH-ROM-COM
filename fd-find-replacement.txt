Alright I’m going a start a series of command line tool replacements. These are tools that replace the old find grep etc tools with more modern ones that are way faster (usually written in rust a c++ like language). And way easier argument syntax.  Be on the lookout.

command line utility replacement #1: first up is fd replacing find

https://github.com/sharkdp/fd

find searches through a directory recursivly to find files based on your arguments.. but has a weird syntax like:

find . -name ‘my name’

fd simplifies this by just accepting the search pattern you want to look for so:

fd .rb

it also ignores all those private directories it shouldn’t go to and anything in .gitignore so it just gives back good results

its alsow waaaaaayyyyy faster ‘fd .rb’ finds all the ruby files in my home directory in 4.6 seconds ‘find ~ -name .rb’ takes 108 seconds to do the same

no down sides just improvements here is the feature set:

mac users install with “brew install fd” and ubuntu users use “sudo apt install fd-find”
